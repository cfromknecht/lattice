Instructions on intalling flint 2
---------------------------------

FLINT 2 follows a standard format for installation:

./configure
make
make check
make install

However, this assumes that MPIR and MPFR are already installed on your system in
/usr/local. If the libraries are not in this location you must specify where 
they are by passing their location to configure. It also assumes you wish to 
install FLINT 2 at the prefix /usr/local. If not you must pass the prefix (the
directory containing lib and include subdirectories into which FLINT will be
installed) to configure:

./configure --with-mpir=/home/user1/mpir-2.1.1/ --with-mpfr=/usr --prefix=/usr

Note that the FLINT configure system can handle MPIR/MPFR as installed (in lib
and include dirs) at some location, or as source builds (built from source and
not installed).

For further configure and make options, please refer to the FLINT 2
documentation.
